Expected goals models


Modelling a probability of scoring a goal depending on an angle and a distance to a goal. Models were created using logistic function and are based on data from matches occurring in top 5 European leagues during which over 43,000 shot events were registered.

Models' Coefficients are exported to a txt file and are later used in xGDataCreator project.

Based on David Sumpter's video about that topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpjLyFyLlXs&t=579s
